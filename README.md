# Finance-App-with-Streamlit
This project has two parts:
1. Performed a complete Data Analysis of a Financial tracking file and built a classification model with Logistic Regression. 
   The model predicts the probability of a given project to end the year within the approved budget. The accuracy is 93%.
2. The second part is a Web App created with Python and Streamlit where the user can upload a file with forecast inputs to get a couple of graphics with comparison between the projects and the average of the portfolio, as well as to find the predictions whether the projects uploaded will or will not meet the budget.
